# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Here are some guidelines and best practices to help you get started.

## Branches

- **`main`**: Contains the production code and is locked for direct modifications.
- **`develop`**: Contains the code under development for the next release.
- **`feature/<name>`**: Used to develop new features.
- **`bugfix/<name>`**: Used to fix bugs.

## Protection of the `main` Branch

To ensure the quality and stability of the production code, the `main` branch is protected and locked to prevent direct modifications. All changes must go through a pull request to the `develop` branch.

Contributors should follow these steps:
- Create a new branch from `develop` for their feature or bugfix.
- Once the work is complete, open a pull request to merge their branch into `develop`.
- Ensure that the pull request has a clear title and description.
- The pull request must pass all tests and receive a code review before being merged.

This workflow ensures that the `main` branch remains stable and that all changes are properly reviewed and tested before being released.

Thank you for your contribution!
