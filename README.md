This project uses the Winget tool to daily update apps (with system context) and notify users when updates are available and installed.

## Intallation
Just [download latest release (WAU.zip)](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/releases/latest/download/WAU.zip), unzip, run "install.bat" as admin to install by default.

## Configurations
### Keep some apps out of Winget-AutoUpdate
- #### BlockList
You can exclude apps from update job (for instance, apps you want to keep at a specific version or apps with built-in auto-update):
Add (or remove) the apps' ID you want to disable autoupdate to 'excluded_apps.txt'. (File must be placed in WAU's installation folder, or re-run install.bat).
- #### Or AllowList
From 1.7.0 version, you can update only pre-selected apps. To do so, create an "included_apps.txt" with the apps' ID of the apps you want to auto-update and run the `Winget-AutoUpdate-Install.ps1` with `-UseWhiteList` parameter. Related post: https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/issues/36

> You can use WiGui to create these lists: https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-Install-GUI

### Notification Level
From version 1.9.0, you can choose which notification will be displayed: Full, Success only or none. Use `-NotificationLevel` parameter when you run `Winget-AutoUpdate-Install.ps1`.

### Notification language
You can easily translate toast notifications by creating your locale xml config file (and share it with us :) ).

### When does the script run?
From version 1.9.0 (on new installations) WAU runs everyday at 6AM. You can now configure the frequency with `-UpdatesInterval` option (Daily, BiDaily, Weekly, BiWeekly, Monthly or Never). You can also add `-UpdatesAtLogon` parameter to run at user logon (recommanded).

### Log location
You can find logs in install location, in logs folder.<br>
If **Intune Management Extension** is installed, a **SymLink** (WAU-updates.log) is created under **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs**<br>
If you are deploying winget Apps with [Winget-Install](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-Install) a **SymLink** (WAU-install.log) is also created under **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs**

### "Unknown" App version
As explained in this [post](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/1255), Winget cannot detect the current version of some installed apps. We decided to skip managing these apps with WAU to avoid retries each time WAU runs:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96626929/155092000-c774979d-2db7-4dc6-8b7c-bd11c7643950.png)

Eventually, try to reinstall or update app manually to see if new version is detected.

### Handle metered connections

We might want to stop WAU on metered connection (to save cellular data on connection sharing for instance). That's why from v1.12.0 the default behavior will detect and stop WAU on limited connections (only for fresh install).

> Previous installed versions will ignore this new setting on update to keep historical operation.

To force WAU to run on metered connections anyway, run new installation with `-RunOnMetered` parameter.

### System & user context
From version 1.15.0, WAU run with system and user contexts. This way, even apps installed on User's scope are updated. Shorcuts for manually run can also be installed.

### Default install location
By default, scripts and components will be placed in ProgramData location (inside a Winget-AutoUpdate folder). You can change this with script argument (Not Recommended).

## GUI installation
[WiGui](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-Install-GUI/) can be used to install WAU even easier:

## Update WAU
### Manual Update
Same process as new installation : download, unzip and run `install.bat`.

### Automatic Update
A new Auto-Update process has been released from version 1.5.0. By default, WAU AutoUpdate is enabled. It will not overwrite the configurations, icons (if personalised), excluded_apps list,...
To disable WAU AutoUpdate, run the `Winget-AutoUpdate-Install.ps1` with `-DisableWAUAutoUpdate` parameter.

## Uninstall WAU
Simply uninstall it from your programs:

## Advanced installation
You can run the `Winget-AutoUpdate-Install.ps1` script with parameters :

**-Silent**<br>
Install Winget-AutoUpdate and prerequisites silently.

**-DoNotUpdate**<br>
Do not run Winget-AutoUpdate after installation. By default, Winget-AutoUpdate is run just after installation.

**-DisableWAUAutoUpdate**<br>
Disable Winget-AutoUpdate update checking. By default, WAU auto updates if new version is available on Github.

**-UseWhiteList**<br>
Use White List instead of Black List. This setting will not create the "excluded_apps.txt" but "included_apps.txt".

**-ListPath**<br>
Get Black/White List from external Path (**URL/UNC/Local/GPO**) - download/copy to Winget-AutoUpdate installation location if external list is newer.<br>
**PATH** must end with a Directory, not a File...<br>
...if the external Path is an **URL** and the web host doesn't respond with a date/time header for the file (i.e **GitHub**) then the file is always downloaded!

If `-ListPath` is set to **GPO** the Black/White List can be managed from within the GPO itself under **Application GPO Blacklist**/**Application GPO Whitelist**. Thanks to [Weatherlights](https://github.com/Weatherlights) in [#256 (reply in thread)](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/discussions/256#discussioncomment-4710599)!

**-ModsPath**<br>
Get Mods from external Path (**URL/UNC/Local/AzureBlob**) - download/copy to `mods` in Winget-AutoUpdate installation location if external mods are newer.<br>
For **URL**: This requires a site directory with **Directory Listing Enabled** and no index page overriding the listing of files (or an index page with href listing of all the **Mods** to be downloaded):
```
<ul>
<li><a  href="Adobe.Acrobat.Reader.32-bit-installed.ps1">Adobe.Acrobat.Reader.32-bit-installed.ps1</a></li>
<li><a  href="Adobe.Acrobat.Reader.64-bit-override.txt">Adobe.Acrobat.Reader.64-bit-override.txt</a></li>
<li><a  href="Notepad++.Notepad++-installed.ps1">Notepad++.Notepad++-installed.ps1</a></li>
<li><a  href="Notepad++.Notepad++-uninstalled.ps1">Notepad++.Notepad++-uninstalled.ps1</a></li>
</ul>
```
Validated on **IIS/Apache**.

>**Nota bene IIS** :
>- The extension **.ps1** must be added as **MIME Types** (text/powershell-script) otherwise it's displayed in the listing but can't be opened
>- Files with special characters in the filename can't be opened by default from an IIS server - config must be administrated: **Enable Allow double escaping** in '**Request Filtering**'

For **AzureBlob**: This requires the parameter **-AzureBlobURL** to be set with an appropriate Azure Blob Storage URL including the SAS token. See **-AzureBlobURL** for more information.

**-AzureBlobURL**<br>
Used in conjunction with the **-ModsPath** parameter to provide the Azure Storage Blob URL with SAS token. The SAS token must, at a minimum, have 'Read' and 'List' permissions. It is recommended to set the permisions at the container level and rotate the SAS token on a regular basis. Ensure the container reflects the same structure as found under the initial `mods` folder. (From version 1.16.4).

**-InstallUserContext**<br>
Install WAU with system and **user** context executions (From version 1.15.3).<br>
Applications installed in system context will be ignored under user context.

**-BypassListForUsers**<br>
Bypass Black/White list when run in user context (From version 1.15.0).

**-NoClean**<br>
Keep critical files when installing/uninstalling. This setting will keep "excluded_apps.txt", "included_apps.txt", "mods" and "logs" as they were.

**-DesktopShortcut**<br>
Create a shortcut for user interaction on the Desktop to run task `Winget-AutoUpdate` (From version 1.15.0).

**-StartMenuShortcut**<br>
Create shortcuts for user interaction in the Start Menu to run task `Winget-AutoUpdate`, open Logs and Web Help (From version 1.15.0).

**-NotificationLevel**<br>
Specify the Notification level: Full (Default, displays all notification), SuccessOnly (Only displays notification for success) or None (Does not show any popup).

**-UpdatesAtLogon**<br>
Set WAU to run at user logon.

**-UpdatesInterval**<br>
Specify the update frequency: Daily (Default), BiDaily, Weekly, BiWeekly, Monthly or Never. Can be set to 'Never' in combination with '-UpdatesAtLogon' for instance.

**-UpdatesAtTime**<br>
Specify the time of the update interval execution time. Default 6AM. (From version 1.15.0).

**-RunOnMetered**<br>
Force WAU to run on metered connections. May add cellular data costs on shared connexion from smartphone for example.

**-MaxLogFiles**<br>
Specify number of allowed log files.<br>
Default is 3 out of 0-99:<br>
Setting MaxLogFiles to 0 don't delete any old archived log files.<br>
Setting it to 1 keeps the original one and just let it grow.

**-MaxLogSize**<br>
Specify the size of the log file in bytes before rotating.<br>
Default is 1048576 = 1 MB (ca. 7500 lines)

**-WingetUpdatePath**<br>
Specify Winget-AutoUpdate installation location. Default: `C:\ProgramData\Winget-AutoUpdate` (Recommended to leave default).

**-Uninstall**<br>
Remove scheduled tasks and scripts.

## Intune/SCCM use
See https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/discussions/88

## Custom scripts (Mods feature)
From version 1.8.0, the Mods feature allows you to run additional scripts when upgrading or installing an app.
Just put the scripts in question with the **AppID** followed by the `-preinstall`, `-upgrade`, `-install` or `-installed` suffix in the **mods** folder.

>- Runs before upgrade/install: `AppID-preinstall.ps1`<br>
>- Runs during upgrade/install (before install check): `AppID-upgrade.ps1`/`AppID-install.ps1`<br>
>- Runs after upgrade/install has been confirmed: `AppID-installed.ps1`

The **-install** mod will be used for upgrades too if **-upgrade** doesn't exist (**WAU** first tries `& $Winget upgrade --id` and if the app isn't detected after that `& $Winget install --id` is tried).<br>
`AppID-install.ps1` is recommended because it's used in **both** scenarios.

> Example:<br>
If you want to run a script that removes the shortcut from **%PUBLIC%\Desktop** (we don't want to fill the desktop with shortcuts our users can't delete) just after installing **Acrobat Reader DC** (32-bit), prepare a powershell script that removes the Public Desktop shortcut **Acrobat Reader DC.lnk** and name your script like this: `Adobe.Acrobat.Reader.32-bit-installed.ps1` and put it in the **mods** folder.

You can find more information on [Winget-Install Repo](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-Install#custom-mods), as it's a related feature.<br>
Read more in the `README.md` under the directory **mods**.

Share your mods with the community:<br>
https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/discussions/categories/mods

### Winget native parameters
Another finess is the **AppID** followed by the `-override` suffix as a **text file** (.**txt**) that you can place under the **mods** folder.
> Example:<br>
**Canneverbe.CDBurnerXP-override.txt** with the content `ADDLOCAL=All REMOVE=Desktop_Shortcut /qn`

This will use the **content** of the text file as a native **winget --override** parameter when upgrading (as proposed by [JonNesovic](https://github.com/JonNesovic) in [Mod for --override argument #244](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/discussions/244#discussion-4637666)).

## GPO Management
In an enterprise environment it's crucial that different groups can have different settings in applications etc. or to implement other mandatory settings, i.e for security/management reasons.<br>
**WAU** doesn't have any setting that can be changed except for when installing (or editing the registry/the task `Winget-AutoUpdate` as **Admin**).<br>
With the use of **ADML/ADMX** files you can manage every **WAU** setting from within **GPO**.<br>
They will be detected/evaluated during the next run of **WAU** (taking effect before any actions).<br>
The **GPO ADMX/ADML** validated with: [Windows 10 - Validate ADMX for Ingestion](https://developer.vmware.com/samples/7115/windows-10---validate-admx-for-ingestion)<br>
Read more in the `README.md` under the directory **Policies**.

## Help
In some cases, you need to "unblock" the `install.bat` file (Windows Defender SmartScreen). Right click, properties and unblock. Then, you'll be able to run it.

## Known issues
* As reported by [soredake](https://github.com/soredake), Powershell from MsStore is not supported with WAU in system context. See https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/issues/113

## Optimization
Feel free to give us any suggestions or optimizations in code and support us by adding a star :)
