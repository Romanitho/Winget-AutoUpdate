# Winget-AutoUpdate (WAU)
This project uses the Winget tool to daily update apps (with system context) and notify users when updates are available and installed.

## Intallation
Just [download project](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-AutoUpdate/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip, run "install.bat" as admin.

## Configurations
### Keep some apps out of Winget-AutoUpdate
You can exclude apps from update job (for instance, apps you want to keep at a specific version or apps with built-in auto-update):
Add (or remove) the apps' ID you want to disable autoupdate to 'excluded_apps.txt'. (File must be placed in scripts' installation folder, or re-run install.bat).
### Default install location
By default, scripts and componants will be placed in ProgramData location (inside a Winget-AutoUpdate folder). You can change this with script argument.
### Notification language
You can easily translate toast notifications by creating your locale xml config file (and share it with us :) ).
### When does the script run?
Scheduled task is set to run:
- At user logon
- At 6AM eveyday (with the -StartWhenAvailable option to be sure it is run at least once a day)
This way, even without connected user, powered on computers get updated anyway.
### Log location
You can find logs in install location, in log folder.

## Update WAU
Same process as new installation : download, unzip and run "install.bat"

## Help
In some cases, you need to "unblock" the "intall.bat" file (Windows Defender SmartScreen). Right click, properties and unblock. Then, you'll be able to run it.

## Optimization
As scripting is not my main job, feel free to give us any suggestions or optimizations in code.
